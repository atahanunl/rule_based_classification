# Calculation of Potential Customer Return with Rule-Based Classification

## Business Problem

A gaming company seeks to develop level-based personas using certain characteristics of its customers. The objective is
to create segments based on these new customer profiles and estimate the potential average contribution of prospective
customers to the company within these segments.

## Dataset Story

The dataset encompasses the pricing information of products offered by an international gaming company,
along with demographic details of users making these purchases. The dataset is compiled from records of individual sales
transactions. Consequently, the table has not been deduped; in other words, a user with specific demographic traits
may have engaged in multiple transactions.
